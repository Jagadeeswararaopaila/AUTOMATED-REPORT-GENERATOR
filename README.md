IN THIS TASK:

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the automation of report generation using Python. The core idea is to build a script that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and then generates a formatted PDF report. The process uses widely used libraries like pandas for data analysis and fpdf for PDF creation. The final output is a downloadable report that displays summary statistics and detailed tables in a clean, professional format.

This task was inspired by a real-world need to reduce manual effort in repetitive data reporting â€” such as generating student report cards, employee evaluations, or performance summaries. The project takes a practical approach to automating such tasks, especially in educational or institutional settings.

 ## Task Objective
# Instructions:
Develop a script that reads data from a file, analyzes it, and generates a formatted PDF report using libraries like fpdf or reportlab.

Deliverables:

A working Python script
A generated PDF report

*Script work as*

.Calculates the average score of all students.

.Identifies the top-performing student.

.Generates a professional-looking PDF report

.Uses FPDF to build a formatted document.

.Includes a title, report generation date, average score, and top performer details.

.Displays all student names and scores in a structured table.

## Elements in this Output 

The output is a PDF file titled score_report.pdf. It includes:

A centered header ("Student Score Report")

Current timestamp of when the report was generated

Average score of all students

Top performer and their score

Tabular listing of all students and their scores

Page footer with page numbers

## Requirements
To run this script, make sure the following libraries are installed:
bash
pip install pandas fpdf

## Real-World Use Cases

- Automated generation of student report cards

- Creating performance reports for teams or departments

- Generating daily/weekly business summaries

- Useful in schools, colleges, HR departments, or even freelancers tracking productivity

## Conclusion
This project fulfills the requirements of the given task to develop a script that reads data from a file, performs some analysis, and then outputs a formatted PDF report using Python. It provides a fully functional, beginner-friendly solution that is easy to extend. You can modify this script to work with different data formats or add more complex analytics, charts, and export features in future enhancements
